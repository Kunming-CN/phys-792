# Interactions explanation:
- Transportation: Transfer process without any loss of energy.
- Ionisation: The process by which an atom or a molecule acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing electrons.
- Bremsstrahlung: The process of production of electromagnetic radiation during the deceleration of charged particle by the deflection of another localized charged particle.
- Annihilation: The process when a subatomic particle collides with its respective antiparticle to produce other particles.
- MultipleScattering: The multiple waves scattering of charged particles in material.
- Rayleigh: The elastic scattering of the electromagnetic radiation by the particle with very small wavelength in comparison to incident radiation.
- PhotoElectricEffect: The process of emission of electron from the atoms by the effect of incident photons.
- ComptonScattering: The scattering of a photon by a charged particle, usually an electron.
- GammaConversion: A radioactive decay process wherein an excited nucleus interacts electromagnetically with one of the orbital electrons of the atom causing the emission of electrons from orbit.
